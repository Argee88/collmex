== Introduction

This library provides a wrapper for the Collmex API. Collmex is an online
accounting service which provides an API.

This library is not complete yet, some record types (and maybe some
features) are missing.

Please create a Pull Request if you've implemented a new type/feature
or create https://github.com/mjaschen/collmex/issues[Issues] for
bugs/feature requests.

There is (or least should be â€¦) a *Type* class for every Collmex
record type ("Satzart"). Currently only the base types (`MESSAGE`,
`LOGIN`, `NEW_OBJECT_ID`) and a few normal record types (e. g. `CMXKND`,
`CMXINV`, `CMXABO`, `CMXUMS`) are implemented.

== Requirements

The Collmex PHP SDK requires PHP 5.5.9. If you're still using older
PHP versions, you can install the 0.4 branch for PHP 5.4 compatibility
or the 0.3 branch for PHP 5.3 compatibility. New features will only go
into the current branch. Bug fixes _may_ be merged back into the old
branches, but don't pin me down on that.

== Installation

Using Composer, just add it to your `composer.json` by running:

```
php composer.phar require mjaschen/collmex
```

== Example

Let's dive in with an example, as this is the easiest way to understand
how the Collmex PHP SDK works. The follwing code loads a customer record
from the Collmex API:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use \MarcusJaschen\Collmex\Client\Curl as CurlClient;
use \MarcusJaschen\Collmex\Request;
use \MarcusJaschen\Collmex\Type\CustomerGet;

// initialize HTTP client
$collmexClient = new CurlClient("USER", "PASSWORD", "CUSTOMER_ID"); <1>

// create request object
$collmexRequest = new Request($collmexClient); <2>

// create a record type; we're querying the API for customer with ID=12345
$getCustomerType = new CustomerGet(['customer_id' => '12345']); <3>

// send HTTP request and get response object
$collmexResponse = $collmexRequest->send($getCustomerType->getCsv()); <4>

if ($collmexResponse->isError()) { <5>
    echo "Collmex error: " . $collmexResponse->getErrorMessage()
         . "; Code=" . $collmexResponse->getErrorCode() . PHP_EOL;
} else {
    // contains one Customer object and the Message object(s)
    $records = $collmexResponse->getRecords(); <6>

    foreach ($records as $record) {
        var_dump($record->getData()); <7>
    }
}
----

<1> The HTTP layer is handled by a `Client` instance; currently we provide
an implementation which uses PHP's `curl` functions. The `Client` expects
_Login Handle_, _Password_, and the _Customer ID_ as constructor arguments.
<2> The `Request` class gets a `Client` as constructor argument
<3> The Collmex API expects and sends so called _Types_ (german: _Satzart_);
in this example we create a _Type_ which queries Collmex for a customer record
<4> the `send()` method of the `Request` instance sends a HTTP request to
the Collmex API and returns an instance of the `Response` class
<5> the `Response` has a method which checks if Collmex answered with
an error
<6> here we extract all records from the response, they are returned as an
array of `Type` instances
<7> the `getData()` method returns an array with all record fields
